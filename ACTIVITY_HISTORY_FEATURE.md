# Lịch sử hoạt động (Activity History) Feature

## Overview
The Activity History feature allows users to view, search, and manage all images they have uploaded to the application. It provides a comprehensive gallery interface with advanced filtering, sorting, and viewing capabilities.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Navigation Integration
- Added "Lịch sử hoạt động" tab to the sidebar navigation
- Integrated with both desktop and mobile navigation
- Uses History icon from Lucide React

### 2. Data Management
- **Database Functions** (`db/images.ts`):
  - `getUserImages()` - Fetch user's images from Supabase storage (private folder structure)
  - `getUserImagesByDateRange()` - Filter images by date range
  - `searchUserImages()` - Search images by filename
  - `groupImagesByTimePeriod()` - Group images by time periods
  - `getUserImageCount()` - Get total image count
  - `uploadUserImage()` - Upload images to user's private folder
- **Storage Structure**: Images stored in `private/{userId}/` folders with proper RLS policies
- **Security**: Uses signed URLs for private image access with 1-hour expiry

### 3. Gallery Layout
- **Compact Grid Design**:
  - 3 columns on mobile (smaller previews)
  - 4-5 columns on tablet
  - 6-7 columns on desktop (optimized for 4:3 aspect ratio)
  - Reduced gap spacing (3px) for more compact layout
- **4:3 Aspect Ratio**: CSS `aspectRatio: '4/3'` with 60px min-height for compact previews
- **Time-based Grouping**:
  - Hôm nay (Today)
  - Hôm qua (Yesterday)
  - Tuần này (This Week)
  - Tháng này (This Month)
  - Tháng trước (Last Month)
  - Cũ hơn (Older)

### 4. Search and Filtering

  - Search by filename
  - Real-time search with form submission
- **Date Range Filtering**:
  - Calendar-based date picker
  - Vietnamese locale support

## Technical Implementation

### Components Structure
```
app/components/ActivityHistory/
├── ActivityHistoryTab.tsx      # Main container component
├── ImageGallery.tsx           # Gallery grid and infinite scroll
├── ImageFilters.tsx           # Search, sort, and date filters
└── ImageModal.tsx             # Lightbox viewer with zoom/rotation
```

### Database Integration
- Uses Supabase Storage API
- Proper user authentication and authorization
- Row Level Security (RLS) compliance
- Efficient querying with pagination

### UI Components Used
- shadcn/ui components (Dialog, Button, Input, Calendar, etc.)
- Lucide React icons
- Next.js Image component for optimization
- date-fns for date formatting

### State Management
- React hooks for local state
- Efficient re-rendering with useCallback
- Proper cleanup and memory management

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. Navigate to "Lịch sử hoạt động" in the sidebar
2. Browse existing images grouped by time periods
3. Use search and filters to find specific images
4. Click on any image to open the detailed viewer
5. Use zoom, rotation, and navigation controls in the modal
6. Download images directly from the modal viewer

### For Developers
1. The feature is fully integrated with the existing authentication system
2. Images are stored in the "images" Supabase storage bucket
3. All components are TypeScript-enabled with proper type definitions
4. Error boundaries and loading states are implemented
5. The feature follows the existing design system and patterns

## Security Considerations
- User images are properly isolated by user ID
- Authentication required for all operations
- No direct file system access
- Supabase RLS policies ensure data security

## Future Enhancements
- Bulk operations (delete, download multiple images)
- Image editing capabilities
- Sharing functionality
- Advanced metadata extraction
- Image categorization and tagging
- Export functionality

## Dependencies Added
- `date-fns` - Date formatting and manipulation
- shadcn/ui components: `calendar`, `popover`, `select`, `label`, `input`, `toast`

## Configuration Changes
- **Next.js Config**: Added Supabase domain to `remotePatterns` for image optimization
- **Image Domains**: Configured to allow Supabase storage URLs for Next.js Image component
- **Image Styling**: Fixed container dimensions to prevent Next.js Image warnings
- **Responsive Design**: Added proper min-height constraints for image containers
